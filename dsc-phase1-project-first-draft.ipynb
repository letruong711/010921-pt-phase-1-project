    "Microsoft is one of the world's longstanding leaders in technology. Aside from corporate sponsorships and Windows Media Player, they have remained silent and distant from the film industry. **This is all about to change!** Microsoft has recently teamed up with Flatiron School to help them identify what variable they need to focus on to produce a successful movie. There are many factors that determine a film's successes. In this presentation, I will focus on three variables that correlate with ratings to help point Microsoft in the right direction. "
